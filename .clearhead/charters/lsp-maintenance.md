# LSP Runtime Maintenance

The extraction established the correct ownership boundary and preserved
behavior, but the new long-running process now needs the ordinary maintenance
surfaces of an independent release.

## Findings

- the public repository only builds inside the platform sibling layout because
  both core and the parser are path dependencies
- document entries and diagnostics survive `didClose`, retaining stale state
  for the lifetime of the server
- workspace folders are captured once during initialization and cannot follow
  client folder changes
- the repository has strong local tests but no independent CI workflow or
  checked-in license text
- the CLI and LSP own almost identical NDJSON file emitters; this is tolerable
  for two adapters but should be an explicit decision before it spreads

## Done gate

- a standalone clone can build and test using documented dependency sources
- document and workspace routing state follows the corresponding LSP lifecycle
- CI enforces formatting, Clippy, unit tests, and stdio protocol tests
- release metadata and license artifacts are complete
- telemetry adapter duplication is either intentionally documented or removed
